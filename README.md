# Project Lover Boy

A little site for Charlotte. Now split into a hub with multiple sections.

**Live Site:** [https://charlotte-3ts.pages.dev](https://charlotte-3ts.pages.dev)

## Structure
- `index.html` - Hub page to navigate between sections
- `app-shell.html` - Persistent site frame for animated page transitions and shared music
- `site-shell-guard.js`, `site-frame.js`, `site-shell.js` - Route pages through the persistent app shell
- `theme.css` - The calm base design: colour, type and spacing tokens, plus shared components (see "Design and motion" below)
- `site-polish.css` - Shared layer that brings every inner page onto the same header, surfaces, buttons and form controls
- `motion.css`, `motion.js` - All animation for the site, in one place
- `love.html` - The heart (draws itself once, tap for a little more) + photo memory
- `messages.html`, `gallery.html`, `timeline.html` - Extra sections
- `rules.html` - Shared rules & boundaries, saved to `rules/rules.json` via `/api/rules`
- `avatar.js` - Shared top-right profile picture button that links to Settings
- `tiktok.html` - Save TikTok links and plan dance dates (dates auto-sync to the calendar)
- `messages.html` - Notes we leave for each other
- `functions/api/heart.js` - Saves shared keepsakes to `heart/heart.json` through the configured GitHub token
- `play.html` - Inside jokes, bingo, and clue hunts
- `our-life.html` - Shared recipes, books and films, monthly awards, and projects
- `question-night.html` - An anytime question room that reveals only when both people are online and ready
- `presence.js` - Shared online indicator, editable playlist, and on-page Spotify player
- `bathroom.html` - Shared bathroom check-ins with each person's profile picture and activity history
- `vault.html`, `vault.js` - Our little safe: shared logins encrypted in the browser and saved as ciphertext through `/api/vault`

## Design and motion

The site is deliberately low-stimulation, because busy screens are tiring. The ideas to keep when adding things:

- **One focal point per screen.** One soft background, one accent colour, very little decoration. Cards are flat; a card inside a card becomes a quiet inset instead of a second card.
- **Chunk, don't stack.** The hub groups its rooms into four small cards (Memories, Plans, Play, Looking after us). Optional tools (like calendar sync) sit in a folded section (`details.fold`) instead of above the main content.
- **Readable by default.** Dark ink on light surfaces, 16px+ text, 44px tap targets, no white text on pale backgrounds.
- **Floating buttons stay out of the way.** The online indicator shows briefly and then rests as a small dot (tap it to read it again). The reaction and music buttons are small and neutral, and slide away while scrolling.
- **Nothing moves on its own.** Every animation runs once, when a page opens, when something new appears, or when you touch something. There are no looping animations anywhere (`document.getAnimations()` finds none).

Everything is driven by tokens at the top of `theme.css` (colours, radii, shadows, type, easing), so the whole look can be re-tuned from one place. The accent follows the colour chosen in Settings.

Motion lives in `motion.css` and `motion.js`: page arrival, newly added items, scroll reveals (`class="reveal"`), press feedback, dialogs, month changes on the calendar, and the pointer glow on hub rows (`class="glow"`). It switches off completely when the device has "reduce motion" on, or when **Reduce animations and movement** is ticked in Settings.

The "together for" timer shows days, hours and minutes and updates once a minute so nothing ticks while reading. To bring the ticking seconds back, set `SHOW_SECONDS = true` at the top of `together.js`.

### Live question room and shared music

The real-time features use a small Cloudflare Durable Object Worker alongside the Pages Functions. Question prompts and answers are stored in its private persistent storage rather than the repository data file:

1. From the repository root, deploy the room Worker with `npx wrangler deploy --config question-room-worker/wrangler.toml`.
2. The root `wrangler.toml` defines the production `QUESTION_ROOM` binding for the `charlotte-question-room` Worker.
3. Deploy the Pages project with `npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name charlotte --branch main` so the binding is attached to the Functions.

The GitHub-connected Pages project must also keep the build command `npm ci --omit=dev`. Pages Functions import `@aws-sdk/*` and `@xmldom/xmldom`; without an install step the build fails with "Could not resolve" errors.

Each person has a private question queue; the other person can see its count but not its text until both are online and press **I’m ready**. A round starts with three questions from each person, with each author asking and their partner answering. Questions and responses persist in the Durable Object, and saved answers include their answer date and time. The shared music widget stores one Spotify playlist link and playback position in the Durable Object; the player attempts to sync play, pause, and position across both browsers. Some phones block remote autoplay and require a local tap. Bathroom check-ins and their recent activity history are also stored in the Durable Object.

## Our little safe (shared logins)

`vault.html` is a quiet, separate page reached from the small **Our little safe** link in the hub footer. It keeps account names and passwords we both need, and it is deliberately not one of the hub cards.

- The browser derives a 256-bit AES-GCM key from the shared passphrase with PBKDF2-SHA256 (310,000 iterations) and a random 16-byte salt. Every save uses a fresh 12-byte IV and the additional data `charlotte-shared-vault-v1`.
- The passphrase and derived key stay in that tab's memory only. They are never sent to Cloudflare, stored in the repository, or written to local storage. The page auto-locks after five idle minutes.
- `/api/vault` requires the normal signed site login. It stores only `{version, kdf, iterations, salt, iv, ciphertext, updatedBy, updatedAt, createdAt}` at the Durable Object key `sharedVault`, and validates the envelope before saving.
- A forgotten passphrase cannot be reset. **Erase our safe** deletes the stored blob for both people; **Change our passphrase** re-encrypts the same entries with a new salt and key.
- A change to the safe's storage actions must be deployed to the room Worker before the page can save (`npx wrangler deploy --config question-room-worker/wrangler.toml`). Never commit a real passphrase or a decrypted export.

## Gallery photo storage (Google Photos)

New photo uploads go directly from the browser to the shared Google Photos account using the Google Photos Library API. Gallery metadata and website album assignments are stored in the existing Question Night Durable Object. The Google OAuth access token stays in that browser session and is not sent to Cloudflare or stored in the repository. Both of us need to connect the same shared Google account from the **Connect our shared Google Photos** button; the site login still identifies Luke or Charlotte as the uploader.

Google Photos only lets this integration list and retrieve media items created through this app. It does not expose the rest of the account library or support API-managed shared albums. The website keeps its own album organization. Existing B2 and GitHub photos are preserved and are not automatically moved or deleted. The earlier B2 setup/migration notes remain available in [the historical storage guide](docs/gallery-storage-migration.md).

### One-time Google setup

In the Google Cloud project used by the website's existing OAuth web client (`molten-crowbar-513403-j7`, project number `924567335912`):

1. Enable **Photos Library API** (done). Without it, uploads fail with a misleading browser CORS error.
2. In OAuth consent **Data Access**, add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary.appendonly` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary.readonly.appcreateddata`.
3. Confirm the OAuth web client has `https://charlotte-3ts.pages.dev` as an authorized JavaScript origin. Add the exact local development origin too if testing locally.
4. If the consent screen is in **Testing**, add the shared Google Photos account as a test user. Google may require app verification before wider production access to Photos scopes.
5. In both browsers, sign in to the same shared Google Photos account on the gallery page and choose **Connect our shared Google Photos**. Google access tokens expire, so reconnect when the page asks.

Uploads are stored at original quality and use the shared account's Google storage. The API does not offer a delete-media-item operation for this flow; deleting an item from Google Photos outside the website can leave a stale entry in our site index.

Gallery login uses server-verified, signed, HttpOnly cookies. Keep login passwords and API credentials out of source control and chat.

Cloudflare Pages continues to serve the site and API. The existing Durable Object remains in use for Question Night, presence, music, bathroom check-ins, and gallery metadata. GitHub-backed memories and rules are not migrated by this change.
